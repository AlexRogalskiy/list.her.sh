On a dark dessert highway, Cool Whip® in my hair  
Warm smell of carnitas rising up through the air  
Up ahead in the distance, I smell some sizzling fries  
My stomach rumbled -- it needs glycogen!  
I just had to supersize  

Hostess stands in the doorway, I heard the taco bell  
I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or calorie hell!"  
Then she holds up a Twinkie® and she throws it my way  
Creamy filling hits my uvula  
Like a fine soufflé  

Welcome to the Hostess® Cafeteria  
Sugar-coated plates (syrup on your face)  
Salad's a disgrace  
For any olfactory criteria  
Fourteen kinds of beer (one by Richard Gere)  
Bagels served with smear  

She loves her froyo twisted, with sprinkles she recommends  
She got a lot of tall, hirsute garçons she calls "Franz!"  
See them push the dessert cart -- sweet Crêpes Suzette!  
Some served from a blender, some *avec baguette*  

So I tackled a garçon,  
"CHOCOLATE NOW MINE!"  
He screamed, "There's some kind of lunatic here lying down on my spine!"  
Still got some morsels of tasty créme brûlée  
Eat 'em up in the middle of a Skype  
With a large latte...
